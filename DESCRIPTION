Description: PenFFR allows multiples functional and scalar covariates. More precisely, It permit you to build two types of functional linear models. A concurrent linear and the integral linear regressions models. To handle heterogeneous data, we also provide a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) version of the linear concurrent model.
