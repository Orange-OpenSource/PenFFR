# PenFFR

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of PenFFR is to design a penalized funtion-on-funtion linear
regression with multiples functional and scalar covariates. This package
allows you to build two types of functional linear models: - The
concurrent linear model whose equation is given by :
$$\mathrm{y}_i(t) = \beta_0(t) + \sum_{\ell=1}^p\beta_\ell(t)\mathrm{x}_i^\ell(t) + \varepsilon_i(t)$$ -
The integral linear model given by :
$$\mathrm{y}_i(t) = \beta_0(t) + \sum_{\ell=1}^p\int_0^t\beta_\ell(s,t)\mathrm{x}_i^\ell(s)\,ds + \varepsilon_i(t)$$

Parameters are estimated using a spline-based expansion with a number of
basis functions that you can set.

To handle heterogeneous data, we also provide a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
version of the linear concurrent model. The conditional density of
$\mathrm{Y}(t)$ according to the function-on-function MoE (FFMoE) model
is $$\begin{eqnarray}
    f(\mathrm{Y}(t)|\mathrm{X}(t),\Psi(t)) &=& \sum_{k=1}^\mathrm{K}\pi_k(\mathrm{X}(t),\alpha_k(t)) \Phi(\mathrm{Y}(t);\mathrm{X}(t)\beta_k(t),\sigma^2_k),\label{ME2}
\end{eqnarray}$$ with $$\begin{itemize}
    \item $\pi_k(\mathrm{X}(t),\ \alpha_k(t))$ the mixture proportion of group $k$, also called the $k^{\text{th}}$ gated network function, depending on the covariate $\mathrm{X}(t)$ through group specific functional parameter $\alpha_k(t)$. More details will be provided in the next section;
    \item $\Psi_k(t) = (\beta_k(t),\alpha_k(t))$ are the functional parameters;
    \item $\Phi(\mathrm{Y}(t); \mathrm{X}_i(t)\beta_k(t), \sigma^2_k)$ is the Gaussian density probability function of mean $\mathrm{X}(t)\beta_k(t)$ and variance $\sigma^2_k$.
\end{itemize}$$
